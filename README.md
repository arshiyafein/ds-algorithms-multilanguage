Data Structures & Algorithms (Multi-Language) 🚀
This repository is a comprehensive collection of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in multiple programming languages, including Python and Java.

The goal of this project is to provide clean, efficient, and well-documented implementations for educational purposes and interview preparation.

🛠️ Implemented Features
🔹 Python
Algorithms: Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick), Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS).

Data Structures: Stack, Queue, Linked List.

🔹 Java
Algorithms: Classic sorting and searching implementations.

Data Structures: Robust implementations of linear and non-linear structures.

🚀 How to Use
Prerequisites
For Python: Python 3.x installed.

For Java: JDK 8+ installed.

Running the Code
To run a Python script:

Bash

python python/algorithms/sorting.py
To compile and run a Java file:

Bash

javac java/structures/Stack.java
java java.structures.Stack
📈 Roadmap
[ ] Add C++ implementations.

[ ] Add Dynamic Programming (DP) problems.

[ ] Include Big O notation for each algorithm.

[ ] Add unit tests for all languages.
