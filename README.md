# Data Structures & Algorithms – Multi-Language Engineering Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a multi-language implementation of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms**, written in **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**.  
The main goal is to demonstrate how the same concepts are designed and implemented across different programming languages, focusing on **clarity, correctness, and performance comparison**.

This repository is intended for **academic use**, **resume presentation**, and **algorithmic practice**.
